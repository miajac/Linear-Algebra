"""**Downloading and visualizing our data**

The simplest way to load the data into Colab is to first download it as a .csv file to your local computer by clicking the link

https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1tWus0zXDSahrms0dl8TTV0Pl8bbWlx9j

This will allow you to download the data as a .csv file. In the top left corner of this screen you should see a little file folder icon.   Selecting it opens a new window to the left of the notebook with three tabs: "Upload", "Refresh", and "Mount Drive". Select "Upload".  This should bring up a window that allows you to select the file "cougar.csv" from your local machine, which will upload the file to your notebook.  You will need to do this again if you decide to close your notebook and reopen it at a later time.

Once you've uploaded your file, convert it to a NumPy array called "cougar" by executing the following cell.

"""**STOP!  BEFORE YOU SUBMIT THIS LAB:**  Go to the "Runtime" menu at the top of this page, and select "Restart and run all".  If any of the cells produce error messages, you will either need to fix the error(s) or delete the code that is causing the error(s).  Then use "Restart and run all" again to see if there are any new errors.  Repeat this until no new error messages show up.

**You are not ready to submit until you are able to select "Restart and run all" without any new error messages showing up. Your code will not be able to be graded if there are any error messages.**

To submit your lab for grading you must first download it to your compute as .py file. In the "File" menu select "Download .py". The resulting file can then be uploaded to http://www.math.byu.edu:30000 for grading.
